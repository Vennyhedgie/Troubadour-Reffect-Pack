# Troubadour-Reffect-Pack
A more visible UI element for Mesmer's Troubadour Elite Specialization

Improved the contrast of Troubadour notes UI. A simple cover-up this time, but I felt like the default UI was pretty bad in terms of visibility.

If you prefer, you can disable the new staff graphic, keeping the old one, and only change the notes themselves:

# How to use
First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable / disable whichever interface size you prefer:

If you only want the notes and not the staff background, disable Staff BG and Staff Lines. Keep Empty Notes enabled.
